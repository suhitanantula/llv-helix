  **LLV MCP** is the first **Model Context Protocol** server that encodes strategy as frequencies.
  Instead of vague mindsets, you **dial the optimal Hz** for the challenge.

  ## ⚡ Quick Start

  ```bash
  # Install
  npm install llv-helix

  # Run demo
  npm run demo

  # Add to Claude Desktop
  npx claude mcp add llv npx -- llv-helix

  Now try frequency-tuned scenarios:

  # Deep strategy (20Hz)
  claude "Analyse competitive positioning at 20Hz"

  # Execution planning (60Hz) 
  claude "Design a 90-day roadmap at 60Hz"

  # Breakthrough innovation (90Hz)
  claude "Generate paradigm-shifting ideas at 90Hz"

  📊 The Hz Revolution

  | Hz Range | Mode              | Best for                           | Output style             |
  |----------|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
  | 20Hz     | Deep strategic    | Market analysis, systems thinking  | Comprehensive, long-term |
  | 40Hz     | Balanced          | Planning, resource allocation      | Structured, practical    |
  | 60Hz     | Focused execution | Implementation, project management | Clear, actionable        |
  | 80Hz     | Crisis response   | Urgent decisions, rapid solutions  | Fast, decisive           |
  | 90Hz     | Breakthrough      | Innovation, paradigm shifts        | Creative, disruptive     |

  🎛️ Scenario Switcher

  Same company, different problems:
  - 20Hz → Ten-year market analysis
  - 40Hz → Board resource decisions
  - 60Hz → 90-day implementation
  - 80Hz → Supply chain crisis
  - 90Hz → AI-native business models

  🧠 Rhythm Engineering

  Prompt engineering → What you askContext engineering → What you provideRhythm engineering → How you think together

  This lets you orchestrate AI's cognitive frequencies—moving between deep strategy, execution, crisis response, and innovation on demand.

  LLV = Lines for structure, Loops for iteration, Vibes for emergence.The Hz dial sets their cognitive mix.
