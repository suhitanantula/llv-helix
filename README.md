> *"AI transformation is organizational design, not technology implementation. Strategy is a systemic approach, not just a statement."*  
> — **Suhit Anantula**, AI Transformation Architect & Author of The Helix Blueprint

An MCP server implementing the revolutionary **Lines-Loops-Vibes framework** — a creativity operating system that transforms how we think, design, and lead in the co-intelligence age. Developed by **Suhit Anantula**, Australia's leading AI Transformation Architect with over 20 years in strategy design and systems thinking.

## 🌟 The LLV Framework: Co-Intelligence in Action

The **Lines-Loops-Vibes Framework** embodies Suhit Anantula's core philosophy that transformation requires alignment of people, process, and purpose. This creativity operating system provides three foundational elements for systematic innovation:

### The Framework Elements:

- **Lines** 〰️: **Creative Flow Pathways** - Connect concepts and enable strategic thinking flow
- **Loops** 🔄: **Iterative Intelligence Cycles** - Systematic iteration with AI-augmented feedback  
- **Vibes** ✨: **Cognitive Energy States** - Modulate creative frequency and organizational atmosphere

### 🎯 The Helix Connection

Born from **The Helix Blueprint** methodology, LLV translates AI transformation principles into practical creative tools:
- **Strategic Design** → Vibes (sensing organizational energy and context)
- **Systems Thinking** → Lines (connecting insights across domains)  
- **Iterative Strategy** → Loops (continuous learning and adaptation)

## 🚀 Enhanced Open Source Features

### ✨ Interactive Creative Flows
Build sophisticated innovation workflows:
- **Component Chaining**: Connect vibes, lines, and loops with relationship types
- **Real-time Insights**: Get AI-augmented feedback as you build
- **Flow Optimization**: Smart scoring and recommendations (0-100+)
- **Connection Intelligence**: Understand how elements influence each other

### 📚 Professional Templates (4 Pre-Built Systems)
Jump-start transformation with expert-designed flows:
- **🚀 Innovation Catalyst**: Systematic breakthrough thinking
- **💼 Strategic Design**: Human-centered strategy development  
- **📖 Narrative Strategy**: Storytelling that drives action
- **🎨 Creative Intelligence**: Artistic and design innovation

## Installation

```bash
# Install MCP SDK dependency
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add lines-loops-vibes node -- /path/to/index.js
```

## Available Tools

### Line Tools
- `create_line`: Create a new line connection with rhythm
- `trace_line`: Send messages along a line with specific speed

### Loop Tools
- `create_loop`: Create an iterative loop with type and rhythm
- `iterate_loop`: Execute one iteration of a loop

### Vibe Tools
- `create_vibe`: Create an energy state with frequency and rhythm
- `pulse_vibe`: Send a pulse through a vibe

### System Tools
- `set_context`: Set context that influences rhythms
- `synchronize`: Sync multiple elements together
- `compose_rhythm`: Compose complex rhythms from components
- `visualize_system`: View the entire system state

## Rhythm Types

### Line Rhythms
- **steady**: Constant flow
- **accelerating**: Building speed
- **pulsing**: On/off pattern
- **syncopated**: Off-beat pattern
- **flowing**: Natural wave-like

### Loop Rhythms  
- **constant**: Unchanging pattern
- **variable**: Changing intervals
- **fibonacci**: Mathematical sequence
- **exponential**: Exponential growth
- **harmonic**: Musical intervals

### Vibe Rhythms
- **ambient**: Atmospheric background
- **driving**: Strong steady beat
- **syncopated**: Complex off-beat
- **polyrhythmic**: Multiple simultaneous rhythms
- **freeform**: Random/improvised

## Context Types

Contexts modify the rhythms of influenced elements:

- **creative**: 1.5x rhythm multiplier
- **analytical**: 0.8x rhythm multiplier  
- **meditative**: 0.5x rhythm multiplier
- **collaborative**: 1.2x rhythm multiplier
- **experimental**: 2.0x rhythm multiplier

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Create elements
create_line("thought_flow", "problem", "solution", "flowing")
create_loop("iterate", "convergent", "fibonacci") 
create_vibe("focus", "intense", 80, "driving")

// Set context
set_context("creative_session", "creative", ["thought_flow", "iterate"])

// Use elements
trace_line("thought_flow", 1.2, "exploring possibilities")
iterate_loop("iterate", "new insight")
pulse_vibe("focus", 0.8, 2)

// Synchronize system
synchronize(["thought_flow", "iterate", "focus"], "creative_flow")

// View system
visualize_system(true, 16)
```

This creates a synchronized creative thinking system where lines, loops, and vibes work together with context-influenced rhythms.

## 🎨 Experience the Enhanced Framework

### Quick Start: Enhanced Creative Playground
```bash
# Experience the enhanced open-source features
node enhanced-examples.js

# Explore interactive creative flows
node creative-flows.js
```

### Build Your First Strategic Flow
```javascript
import { CreativeFlowBuilder } from './creative-flows.js';

const builder = new CreativeFlowBuilder();

// Create AI transformation strategy flow
builder.createFlow('ai_transformation', 'Organizational AI integration strategy');

// Strategic sensing (The Helix approach)
builder.addComponent('vibe', {
  name: 'org_intelligence',
  energy: 'focused',
  frequency: 45,     // Strategic analysis mode
  rhythm: 'driving'
});

// Connect insights across domains
builder.addComponent('line', {
  name: 'transformation_pathway',
  from: 'current_state',
  to: 'ai_native_org',
  rhythm: 'accelerating'
});

// Continuous learning cycles
builder.addComponent('loop', {
  name: 'capability_building', 
  type: 'spiral',
  rhythm: 'fibonacci'
});

// Real-time insights: "🎯 Strategic Flow Score: 125/100"
//                    "💡 Excellent flow! Ready for implementation"
```
