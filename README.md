**LLV MCP** is the first **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that encodes strategy as frequencies.  
Instead of vague mindsets, you **dial the optimal Hz** for the challenge.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install llv-helix

# Run demo
npm run demo

# Add to Claude (Desktop)
npx claude mcp add llv npx -- llv-helix

Now try frequency-tuned scenarios:

# Deep strategy at 20Hz
claude "Analyse competitive positioning at 20Hz"

# Execution planning at 60Hz
claude "Design a 90-day roadmap at 60Hz"

# Breakthrough innovation at 90Hz
claude "Generate paradigm-shifting ideas at 90Hz"

##📊 The Hz Revolution

###The frequency spectrum

  | Hz Range | Mode              | Best for                           | Output style             |
  |----------|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
  | 20Hz     | Deep strategic    | Market analysis, systems thinking  | Comprehensive, long-term |
  | 40Hz     | Balanced          | Planning, resource allocation      | Structured, practical    |
  | 60Hz     | Focused execution | Implementation, project management | Clear, actionable        |
  | 80Hz     | Crisis response   | Urgent decisions, rapid solutions  | Fast, decisive           |
  | 90Hz     | Breakthrough      | Innovation, paradigm shifts        | Creative, disruptive     |

##Try a few modes:

# Deep strategy (20Hz)
claude "Analyse competitive positioning at 20Hz using LLV MCP"

# Execution planning (60Hz)
claude "Create a 90-day roadmap at 60Hz with clear milestones"

# Breakthrough ideas (90Hz)
claude "Generate disruptive concepts at 90Hz for a new AI-native line of business"

#Scenario switcher (same company, different problems):

	•	10–20Hz for a ten-year market narrative
	•	30–40Hz for board options and resourcing
	•	50–60Hz for 90-day implementation
	•	70–80Hz for supply chain shocks
	•	90–100Hz for AI-native business model exploration
 
##Rhythm engineering

Prompt engineering tunes what you ask.
Context engineering tunes what you give it.
Rhythm engineering tunes how you think together.

Prompt → Context → Rhythm
"What do I ask?" → "What do I provide?" → "How do we think together?"

This lets you orchestrate AI’s cognitive frequencies — moving between deep strategy, execution, crisis response, and innovation.

LLV = Lines for structure, Loops for iteration, Vibes for emergence.
The Hz dial sets their mix.

🌟 Why it matters
	•	Simplify complex strategy into tunable frequencies
	•	Explore scenarios across different organisational modes
	•	Encode strategy into MCP for use in Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and beyond
	•	Open source and MIT licensed — free to extend
