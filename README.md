## 🧠 What is LLV?

Lines–Loops–Vibes (LLV) is a strategic intelligence framework introduced in The Helix Moment.

- Lines 〰️ Structure and pathways
- Loops 🔄 Learning cycles and feedback
- Vibes ✨ Energy and cultural context

In this MCP server, LLV becomes Strategic Intelligence as Code.
Developers and strategists can model rhythms, switch frequencies, and embed strategic thinking directly into AI workflows.

Built with 🧠 by Suhit Anantula | Strategic Intelligence as Code

- **creative**: 1.5x rhythm multiplier
- **analytical**: 0.8x rhythm multiplier  
- **meditative**: 0.5x rhythm multiplier
- **collaborative**: 1.2x rhythm multiplier
- **experimental**: 2.0x rhythm multiplier

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Create elements
create_line("thought_flow", "problem", "solution", "flowing")
create_loop("iterate", "convergent", "fibonacci") 
create_vibe("focus", "intense", 80, "driving")

// Set context
set_context("creative_session", "creative", ["thought_flow", "iterate"])

// Use elements
trace_line("thought_flow", 1.2, "exploring possibilities")
iterate_loop("iterate", "new insight")
pulse_vibe("focus", 0.8, 2)

// Synchronize system
synchronize(["thought_flow", "iterate", "focus"], "creative_flow")

// View system
visualize_system(true, 16)
```

This creates a synchronized creative thinking system where lines, loops, and vibes work together with context-influenced rhythms.
