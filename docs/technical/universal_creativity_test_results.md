## Key Discoveries

### 1. Universal Cognitive Framework
The 6D Creativity System operates as a **universal cognitive framework** that maintains consistent frequency effects while adapting output to domain-specific requirements.

### 2. Frequency-Confidence Correlation
Higher frequencies consistently produce higher confidence levels for innovation tasks across all domains, suggesting optimal frequency selection based on task type.

### 3. Domain-Specific Adaptation
While cognitive patterns remain consistent, the system automatically generates domain-appropriate outputs:
- **Business:** Strategic terminology and market-focused solutions
- **Product:** Technical architectures and user-centered features
- **Writing:** Literary techniques and narrative structures
- **Marketing:** Campaign strategies and audience engagement tactics

### 4. Creative Intensity Scaling
The exponential increase in creative intensity (2% → 245%) demonstrates the system's ability to modulate creative force across a massive dynamic range.

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Task-Frequency Matching
Match cognitive frequency to task requirements:
- Strategic planning → Low frequency (20-30 Hz)
- Implementation → Mid frequency (50-70 Hz)
- Innovation → High frequency (85-95 Hz)

### 2. Progressive Frequency Development
For complex projects, progress through frequency ranges:
1. Start with low-frequency deep analysis
2. Move to mid-frequency systematic development
3. Apply high-frequency innovation for breakthroughs

### 3. Domain Calibration
While patterns are universal, calibrate specific frequencies within ranges for domain optimization:
- Technical domains: Slightly higher baseline (e.g., 25Hz vs 18Hz for analysis)
- Creative domains: Wider frequency ranges for exploration
- Strategic domains: Balanced progression through all ranges

### 4. Confidence Threshold Management
- Accept lower confidence (61-63%) during foundation phases
- Expect higher confidence (84-85%) during innovation phases
- Use confidence levels to validate frequency selection
