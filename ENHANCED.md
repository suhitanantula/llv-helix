## LLV MCP Server — The Enhanced Guide

### Strategic Intelligence as Code

## ⚡ The Hz Revolution

LLV introduces a **frequency-based approach to strategy**:
instead of vague “mindsets,” you dial in the *optimal frequency* for the challenge.

- **Lines at 20Hz** → long-term system architecture
- **Loops at 60Hz** → rapid sprint feedback
- **Vibes at 90Hz** → breakthrough collaboration

### 1. Scaling a Startup

- **Challenge**: Find product-market fit, then scale.
- **LLV Rhythm**:
  - Start in Loops (20–40Hz) to experiment.
  - Add Lines (60Hz) once patterns stabilize.
  - Keep Vibes tuned (70–90Hz) for culture and innovation.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
create_loop("product_experiments", "divergent", "variable");
create_vibe("market_sensing", "attentive", 60, "freeform");
create_line("revenue_pipeline", "leads", "conversion", "flowing");

set_context("scale_stage", "experimental", ["product_experiments", "market_sensing"]);

iterate_loop("product_experiments", { hypothesis: "add pricing tier" });
pulse_vibe("market_sensing", 0.8, 2);
trace_line("revenue_pipeline", 1.2, "optimize funnel");

synchronize(["product_experiments", "market_sensing", "revenue_pipeline"], "scale_rhythm");
visualize_system(true, 10);
```

### 2. Turning Around a Stalled Project

- **Challenge**: Rigid structures, low morale, blocked delivery.
- **LLV Rhythm**:
  - Introduce Loops (30–50Hz) for quick wins.
  - Reset Vibes (40–60Hz) to restore collaboration.
  - Gradually rebuild Lines (60Hz) once momentum returns.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
create_line("project_flow", "initiation", "delivery", "steady");
create_loop("feedback_cycle", "convergent", "fibonacci");
create_vibe("team_morale", "restorative", 70, "ambient");

set_context("turnaround", "collaborative", ["feedback_cycle", "team_morale"]);

iterate_loop("feedback_cycle", { issue: "blocker review" });
pulse_vibe("team_morale", 1.0, 3);
trace_line("project_flow", 0.8, "reassign responsibilities");

synchronize(["project_flow", "feedback_cycle", "team_morale"], "turnaround_flow");
visualize_system(true, 8);
```

## 📈 Outcomes & Impact

- 25%+ project efficiency improvement reported in trials
- Reduced stress via early Vibes monitoring
- Accelerated learning cycles through structured Loops
- Enhanced strategic thinking through frequency-based states

## 🌟 Vision

“Making Strategic Intelligence Invisible”

LLV MCP transforms strategy from something you have to learn into something you can experience directly.
Every Claude / MCP interaction becomes strategically intelligent by default.

**Roadmap:**

- v1.1: Pattern recognition & ML hooks
- v1.2: Real-time collaboration features
- v1.3: Advanced frequency modulation
- v2.0: Enterprise integration suite

## 🔮 Why an Enhanced Guide?

The **README** gives you the essentials — install, run, and start using LLV.
This **Enhanced Guide** goes deeper: it explains the **frequency spectrum**, shows **real scenarios**, and outlines the **bigger vision** behind LLV as the world’s first **Strategic Intelligence framework as code**.

## ⚡ The Hz Revolution

LLV introduces a **frequency-based approach to strategy**:
instead of vague “mindsets,” you dial in the *optimal frequency* for the challenge.

| Hz Range     | Cognitive State             | Best For                                 | Strategic Output                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **10–20Hz**  | Ultra Deep Strategic        | Market analysis, competitive positioning | Systems thinking, long-term vision        |
| **30–40Hz**  | Balanced Strategic          | Planning, resource allocation            | Structured frameworks, balanced decisions |
| **50–60Hz**  | Focused Execution           | Implementation, project management       | Clear pathways, actionable plans          |
| **70–80Hz**  | High-Energy Problem Solving | Crisis response, urgent optimizations    | Rapid solutions, decisive actions         |
| **90–100Hz** | Breakthrough Innovation     | Blue-sky thinking, paradigm shifts       | Revolutionary ideas, creative leaps       |

## 🧠 LLV Explained

- **Lines** 〰️ — Structure and pathways (clarity, stability, process)
- **Loops** 🔄 — Iteration and feedback (learning, adaptation, testing)
- **Vibes** ✨ — Energy and culture (context, conditions, resonance)

When combined with **Hz frequencies**, each element shifts into a different mode.
- **Lines at 20Hz** → long-term system architecture
- **Loops at 60Hz** → rapid sprint feedback
- **Vibes at 90Hz** → breakthrough collaboration

## 🚀 Core Tools (Hz-Enhanced)

| Tool | Hz Range | Purpose | Example Command |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `llv_hz_analyze` | 10–100Hz | Frequency-optimized analysis | `@llv 20hz "Competitive analysis needed"` |
| `llv_deep_strategic` | 10–30Hz | Systems thinking, long-term | `@llv 20hz "5-year market positioning"` |
| `llv_balanced_planning` | 40–50Hz | Structured planning | `@llv 45hz "Resource allocation for Q4"` |
| `llv_focused_execution` | 50–70Hz | Implementation focus | `@llv 60hz "Sprint planning optimization"` |
| `llv_breakthrough_innovation` | 80–100Hz | Creative leaps | `@llv 90hz "Reimagine onboarding"` |

**Classic LLV tools** (`llv_lines_analyze`, `llv_loops_analyze`, `llv_vibes_monitor`) are all frequency-aware.
